# Delivery of equipment

## Use Kvipp to provide training when delivering equipment

When you as e.g. a supplier delivers some equipment to a type, you can use Kvipp to document the training. 

## Without a attached QR code

This is how you do it:
1) Go the web page kvipp.it
2) Scan your HSE card (or other ID)
3) Use artifical intelligence to recognise the equipment
4) Register your competence
5) Start practical training
6) Run through the checklist
7) You can add the participants at the end of the session

This service is free and open for anyone. 

## Equipment with QR code from DigiQuip or Reginnn
Go to the web page kvipp.it and scan the QR code from there. Then follow the process as described above.

## How can the participant find their proof?
The person who gets the training, can find the documentation from kvipp.it. The employer can find all documentation in Kvipp Bedrift, if a subscriber.

Go to the web page kvipp.it:
1) Scan your own HSE card
2) Add e-mail address
3) Documentation will be sent by e-mail

In Kvipp Bedrift, the documentation will automatically be added to the right person and documentation can easily be downloaded. You can also send documentation post the training by clicking through to the session, selecting who and add recipient e-mail adress.
