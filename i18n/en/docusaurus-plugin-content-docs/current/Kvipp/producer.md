# Kvipp - as supplier

When you as a supplier of machines and equipment provide equipment-specific training, you can document it in Kvipp. With Kvipp, the equipment-specific training is automatically stored digitally, and the customer gets all the overview on an ongoing basis. Giving and receiving training in Kvipp costs nothing.

## What is equipment-specific training
For equipment that "requires special caution when used", **all employees must have necessary training in the use of the work equipment and only employees who have received training should use it.** This is the employer's responsibility. If an employee is to use a tandem roller Volvo DD25B, for example, this is precisely the type of work equipment for which training must be provided (see the regulation "forskrift om utførelse av arbeid", chapter 10).

Note: Equipment-specific training is in addition to certificates of competence, certifications and courses, and it is important that the company has routines for this and that the employees themselves are aware of the training requirements. See chapters 10 and 11 in the regulation "forskrift om utførelse av arbeid" for more information.

## How to provide training
Go to the website [kvipp.it](https://kvipp.it)
To provide training, you must first register your own training. Then you get the option "provide training" and the training session can be started.

1.Identify yourself and the equipment
2.Start by selecting "provide training"
3.Go through a general checklist
4.Add the participants at the end by taking a picture or scanning ID cards. There is no upper limit to how many participants can be added

## How the customer finds completed training
All training is automatically registered on the employee. If the customer has Kvipp Admin, the manager can get an overview of all training in the system for the company.

If the customer doesn't have Kvipp Admin:
-**The customer wishes to receive training certificates by email**. In the dropdown menu by name, email can be added. Remember to tick to receive previous training certificates.

import email from '/img/kvipp-docs-people/email.jpg';

<img src={email} style={{width:500}} />

-**Download training certificate**

import proof from '/img/kvipp-docs-people/proof.jpg';

<img src={proof} style={{width:200}} />

Training certificates can also be sent later, more on this furhter below.

## Identify work equipment without and with QR code

**Without QR code**
1 Go to the website kvipp.it.
2 Scan your HSE card.
3 Use artificial intelligence to identify make and model. **Make sure to take a picture that captures both make and model, and that it is read correctly.**
4 Register your own training
5 Start practical training
6 Go through the general checklist
7 Add the participants at the end of the session

**With QR codes from DigiQuip or Reginn**
Go to kvipp.it and scan the QR code, then follow the same process as above. Read more about how to connect QR codes under work equipment.

**Search and create equipment**
With the Equipment Owner role, which is given under permissions in Kvipp Admin, you can search and create equipment. You get a new option called "search". Then follow the wizard.

## Training on behalf of the company

With the teacher role, the person providing training gets more options:
- Can provide training on multiple equipment in the same session.
- Can provide training on behalf of the company. The training certificate will state that training is given on behalf of the company.

The role is assigned in Kvipp Admin on the permissions page.

**One of the main advantages of being a teacher is that all training is stored in a separate overview in Kvipp Admin.** The overview includes all people that the teacher has trained - both internal and external. To retrieve who has received training, you can search by participant name and equipment type. **Here you also have the option to send documentation (PDF) directly by email.**
