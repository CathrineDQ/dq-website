# Equipment
## Identification of machines and equipment

**Artificial intelligence and machine learning** enable the recognition of equipment through images. For the system to identify the equipment correctly, it is essential to find specific characteristics that indicate the type and model. You should look for the following elements:

+ Serial number plate: This plate often contains important information about the equipment.
+ Brand or logo: The brands can help with the quick identification of the make and model.
+ QR codes: If the equipment has a QR code, the system can read it automatically, making the process even easier. **Scan a QR code** from DigiQuip, Reginn, Kvipp or BRAREG, and the information will be interpreted.

## Label work equipment (recommended)
With Kvipp Bedrift, you can also label equipment with QR codes. Using QR codes can make it easier for employees to check the status of their training and documentation.

Even though the solution employs advanced libraries for artificial intelligence and machine learning, it is important to be aware that there is always a risk of incorrect information being recorded. For instance, if a person scans a machine and overlooks that it is the wrong type, this will result in the machine being registered incorrectly. The consequences of this can be significant, especially as it may affect the documentation of training and other processes later on.

**Link to a QR code:**
Under "permissions" in Kvipp Bedrift, you define who should be able to link to a QR code. This role is called "equipment owner."

Then, the equipment can be labelled, and you can best do this in the field:
+ Take a picture of the equipment
+ Select "link QR code"
+ Done!

You can order QR codes from us. [Click here for more information](https://digiquip.no/docs/prices/detailed-price-list)
