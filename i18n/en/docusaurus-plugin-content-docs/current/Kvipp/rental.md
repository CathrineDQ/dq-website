# Kvipp - as rental company

For equipment that "requires special caution when used", **all employees must have necessary training in the use of the work equipment and only employees who have received training should use it.** This is the employer's responsibility. If an employee is to use a tandem roller Volvo DD25B, for example, this is precisely the type of work equipment for which training must be provided (see the regulation "Forskrift om utførelse av arbeid", chapter 10).

Note: Equipment-specific training is in addition to certificates of competence, certifications and courses, and it is important that the company has routines for this. See chapters 10 and 11 in the regulation "Forskrift om utførelse av arbeid" for more information.

As a rental provider of machines and equipment, the lessor is responsible for ensuring that the equipment is in proper order, but it is always the employer who is responsible for ensuring that their employees have received training in the equipment to be used. The training responsibility cannot be outsourced as the employer retains the legal responsibility for the employee's safety.

Remember that as a rental provider, you are also an employer for your own employees who use machines and equipment.

## Training as a service
As a rental provider, you can offer equipment-specific training as a service. Giving or receiving training in Kvipp costs nothing and can be performed by anyone at any time.

## How to provide training
Go to the website [kvipp.it](https://kvipp.it)
To provide training, you must first register your own training. Then you get the option "give equipment training" and the training session can be started.

1.Identify yourself and the equipment
2.Start by selecting "give equipment training"
3.Go through a general checklist
4.Add the participants at the end by taking a picture or scanning ID cards. There is no upper limit to how many participants can be added

## Identify work equipment without and with QR code

**Without QR code**
1 Go to the website kvipp.it.
2 Scan your HSE card.
3 Use artificial intelligence to identify make and model. **Make sure to take a picture that captures both make and model, and that it is read correctly.**
4 Register your own training
5 Start practical training
6 Go through the general checklist
7 Add the participants at the end of the session

**With QR codes from DigiQuip or Reginn**
Go to kvipp.it and scan the QR code, then follow the same process as above. Read more about how to connect QR codes under work equipment.

**Search and create equipment**
With the Asset Owner role, which is given under permissions in Kvipp Admin, you can search and create equipment. You get a new option called "search". Then follow the wizard.

## How the customer finds completed training
All training is automatically registered on the employee. If the customer has Kvipp Admin, the manager can get an overview of all training in the system for the company.

If the customer doesn't have Kvipp Admin:

-**The customer wishes to receive training certificates by email.** In the dropdown menu by name, email can be added. Remember to tick to receive previous training certificates.

import email from '/img/kvipp-docs-people/email.jpg';

<img src={email} style={{width:500}} />

-**Download training certificate**

import proof from '/img/kvipp-docs-people/proof.jpg';

<img src={proof} style={{width:200}} />

Training certificates can also be sent later, more on this below.

## Training others on behalf of our company
With Kvipp Admin, you can get a complete overview of who you have provided training to. With the "teacher" role, all training sessions appear in an overview, and it is possible to send documentation afterwards.

**Permissions in Kvipp Admin:**

import myndighetlærer from '/img/myndighetlærer.png';

<img src={myndighetlærer} style={{width:1100}} />

The overview includes all people that the teacher has trained - both internal and external. To retrieve who has received training, you can search by participant name and equipment type. Here you also have the option to send documentation (PDF) directly by email.

import lessonsEN from '/img/kvipp-docs-people/lessonsEN.jpg';

 <img src={lessonsEN} style={{width:700}} />

 ## Multiple equipment in one training session
With the "teacher" role, training can be provided on multiple equipment in the same training session.

- Assign the teacher authority in Kvipp Admin. You do this on the page called permissions.
- The person providing training chooses to provide training on behalf of the company and thus gets the opportunity to add more equipment.
- In the training session, the teacher goes through the checklist once. This means that if some of the checkpoints vary, the equipment is not suitable to be part of the same session.
