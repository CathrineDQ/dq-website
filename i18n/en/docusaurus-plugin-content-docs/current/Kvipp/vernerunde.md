# Vernerunde

## Bruk Kvipp på vernerunden for å sjekke utstyrsspesifikk opplæring

During equipment inspection rounds, use Kvipp to check if personnel have the correct equipment-specific training.

Here's how:

1) Go to the website kvipp.it.
2) Scan the person's Norwegian HSE card.
3) Scan the equipment using either the serial number plate or QR code (DigiQuip). Artificial intelligence recognizes the brand and model; it's crucial that these are visible in the image.
4) You will now see the status! Either the person is "good to go," or the training is missing.

If training is missing, provide on-the-spot training or have the person fill out the self-declaration form.
