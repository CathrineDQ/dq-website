# Integration with Kompetanseregisteret (K-REG)

Kompetanseregisteret is a registry operated by Sentralregisteret for registration of various competencies. Equipment-specific training completed in Kvipp can be uploaded directly to K-REG.

### Automatic transfer of equipment-specific training

When a person with the role of "instructor" provides practical equipment-specific training to any of your employees, the result is automatically uploaded to K-REG. This includes both internal training and training received from rental companies, manufacturers, and others who use Kvipp AND have registered instructors.

Self-declarations and training provided without the instructor role are NOT uploaded.

### Why K-REG integration?

- **No manual data registration required** - Everything happens automatically after completed training
- **Ongoing documentation of equipment-specific training** - Complete history of all training
- **Visible in HMSREG via Kompetanseregisteret** - Training becomes available in the HMSREG system

### Complete solution

The integration automatically handles:
- Both Norwegian and foreign workers
- Training certificates (PDF) become available both in Kvipp and Kompetanseregisteret
- Equipment information (brand and model) is always registered correctly
- Automatic creation of profiles for foreign workers with HMS cards

We transfer information about who has received training, from whom (instructor), company, brand and model of the equipment, date and the actual training certificate (PDF).

### Organizational control

Each organization can control whether the K-REG integration should be active. The integration also works for external training provided by authorized instructors.

### Contact us to activate the integration

Call us at **69 83 85 00** or send an email to **support@digiquip.no** to activate the K-REG integration for your organization.

## HMSREG integration

Kompetanseregisteret has an integration with HMSREG. This means that you will also get equipment-specific training visible in HMSREG.

# Other integrations

Kvipp is built to integrate with other systems. Contact us to hear about the possibilities for connecting with your existing systems.

### API access

For larger organizations, we can offer API access to integrate Kvipp directly with their own systems. This makes it possible to:

- Automatically synchronize people and equipment
- Retrieve training data

## Security

All integrations use secure API endpoints with token-based authentication. Data is encrypted in transit and at rest.

## Availability

The integrations are available 24/7 with high uptime. We continuously monitor all integrations to ensure reliable operation.

## Support

Technical support for integrations is provided through our support team. Contact us at support@digiquip.no for help with integrations.
