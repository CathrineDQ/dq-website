# People and trainings

## Identification of persons

For the identification of persons, the following can be used:
+ Health and Safety (HSE) card (recommended)
+ Driving licence
+ PocketID
+ Passport
+ Kvipp QR code

We always recommend using the QR code on the HSE card. By using the HSE card, training is automatically linked to both the correct person and organisation. This way, the organisation will automatically have an ongoing overview of all training (Kvipp Bedrift).

[Test it yourself here](https://kvipp.it)

## Registration of training
When you are about to start equipment training, you can either receive training from someone else or fill out a self-declaration.

If you have training documented on a piece of paper, you can also take a photo of it and save it in Kvipp. This makes it easier to present documentation at short notice.

## Providing training
To provide training, you must first have the necessary competence on the equipment. Kvipp reflects this requirement by ensuring that the individua must have documented training. Once training is registered, the option "provide training" will appear, and a training session can be initiated.

+ Identify yourself and the equipment
+ Start by selecting "start training"
+ Go through a general checklist
+ Finally, add the participants by taking a picture or scanning their ID cards

Remember: Use the HSE card if you have it, so that the training is immediately associated with the correct organisation.

## Multiple equipment in one training session

With the "teacher" role, training can be provided on multiple pieces of equipment in the same training session.

- Assign the teacher authority in Kvipp Bedrift. This is done on the page called "authorities".
- The person delivering the training behalf of the company and can add multiple pieces of equipment.
- In the training session, the instructor goes through the checklist once.  That is, if any of the checklist points vary, the equipment is not suitable to be part of the same session.

How to start practical training:
- Go to kvipp.it
- Scan the HSE card
- Scan a piece of equipment (and ensure you are "good to go")
- Select "start training". Then the option to add more equipment will appear.
- Go through the checklist and add the participants at the end of the session.

Note that the "teacher" role is an additional role.
- Administrator: 180 NOK per person (three administrators are included)
- Teacher: 90 NOK per person
- Asset owner: 90 NOK per person

*Administrators can always be given the instructor and equipment owner roles as included in the price.*

## Overview of trainings
In Kvipp Bedrift, you will find an overview of training, and you can download training certificates. You can check all training for an individual, who is authorised to use a piece of equipment, or create groups that give you a clearer view of multiple individuals and equipment.

## Groups and overview
You can easily create groups with people and equipment. By grouping, you get a quick overview of status, training gaps, and it becomes easier to ensure these are closed. In addition, you can print a QR code for the group. When you scan that QR code, you get all the equipment in the group, giving you a shortcut to start training on many equipment items simultaneously.

Groups are intended to simplify the work of ensuring that people have the necessary training. Perhaps you want to group by subject, to plan when you hire new employees, or as a temporary project, you can test out groups for this.

## Trainings on behalf of my organisation
If you want to define who is a teacher on behalf of your company, go to "authorities" and select people as teachers. In the documentation, it will then appear that the person has provided training on behalf of the company, which makes it extra traceable.

With the role of "teacher", all training sessions end up in an overview. The overview includes all the people the teacher has trained - both internal and external. To retrieve who has received training, you can search by participant name and equipment type.

## Do you already have trainings in DigiQuip?
To transfer equipment-specific training from DigiQuip to Kvipp, the following information is required:
+ First name
+ Last name
+ Last name
+ Date of birth

In this way, we can identify who you are in both systems.
