# Getting Started

To get started with Kvipp and the documentation of equipment training, the barrier to entry is very low. We have designed Kvipp with the aim of making it super easy to document trainings in the field – because that’s where it happens! In practice, you only need an ID card (e.g. HSE card), work equipment, and a mobile device.

## Getting off to a good start

+ **Involve the organisation**
Communicate and inform the importance of ensuring that training and documentation take place. Make training a routine.

Why is this important? Because training pays off. It’s about doing the job well, safely, and securely. This is why there are legal requirements, which also means that work can be halted if documentation is missing.

+ **Ensure everyone knows that training should be documented digitally from kvipp.it**
When using Kvipp, you will do it from the website kvipp.it. To get started quickly, inform your team, put up posters, and advise employees to save the site to their home screen.

:::note[Save kvipp to Home Screen]
1. Open Chrome or Safari
2. Go to kvipp.it
3. Add to Home Screen:
   Chrome: To the right of the address bar, click Share, then Add to Home Screen.
   Safari: Click on   in the menu bar. Scroll down to the list of options, and then click on Add to Home Screen.

:::

+ **If you have an HSE card, use it.**
With the HSE card, all training is automatically added to your organisation. Alternatively, you can use a driving licence or passport. For secondary schools, we also support PocketID; please contact us to get this set up.

## Step by Step

1. **Go to the website kvipp.it**
To familiarise yourself with Kvipp, we believe the best method is to give it a try. Can you use a ruler?

2. **Scan the HSE card (or another ID card)**
To use Kvipp, identify yourself with an Norwegian HSE card, driving licence, or passport. We recommend using the HSE card, as the training will be automatically linked to the correct organisation.

+ HSE card: Use the QR code option and scan the QR code on the HSE card.
+ Passport or driving licence: Take a photo of your passport or driving licence. Artificial intelligence will interpret the information, and you can confirm if it is correct.

There is no need to create users in advance, meaning you also do not need usernames and passwords. This saves you a lot of administration and follow-up!

Under the name, you can add an email address. This way, you will automatically receive all training certificates.

3. **Scan or take a picture of the equipment you will use**
Equipment can be identified either by scanning labels or allowing artificial intelligence to recognise it.
+ Labels: Use the QR code option and scan QR codes from DigiQuip, Reginn (M-reg) or BRAREG.
+ No labels: Take a picture of the equipment, ensuring the brand and model are included. For instance, a serial number plate often contains the correct information. The key is to capture the brand and model.

PS: Even when you take a photo, Kvipp will recognise QR codes thanks to built-in artificial intelligence and machine learning.

**Note! You do not need to label the equipment or add this in advance. Kvipp can be used without any preparation.**

4. **Training Status**
When both the individual and equipment are identified, you will see the training status.
+ Training missing. "Ooops! You lack the competence to use this equipment" clearly indicates that documentation has not been registered. You can then either upload previous documentation, fill out a self-declaration, or find someone who can provide the training.
+ Training in place. "Good to go" tells you that documentation is in order. You can now also train others.

## Once you have registered that you can use the equipment, you can also train others.
Select "provide training" and go through the general checklist. Add participants at the end of the session.
