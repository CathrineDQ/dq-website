# Kvipp - as employer

For equipment that "requires special caution when used", **all employees must have necessary training in the use of the work equipment and only employees who have received training should use it.** This is the employer's responsibility. If an employee is to use a tandem roller Volvo DD25B, for example, this is precisely the type of work equipment for which training must be provided (see the regulation "forskrift om utførelse av arbeid", chapter 10).

The employer has a duty to provide training in everything related to the employee's work. In the Working Environment Act § 3-2, you can read more about the obligation to provide:
Point 1: Necessary training
Point 2: Personal protective equipment and training in use
Point 3: Possible preparation of written instructions

## The main rule is training

- Large machines should always have equipment-specific training. If use requires a certificate, you must have equipment-specific training before using the machine.
- For smaller equipment (e.g. handheld), it may be sufficient to receive equipment-specific training on one type within the category, provided that the types are "similar". Include this in your written training policy.

Note: Equipment-specific training is in addition to certificates of competence, certifications and courses, and it is important that the company has routines for this and that the employees themselves are aware of the training requirements. See chapters 10 and 11 in the regulation "forskrift om utførelse av arbeid" for more information.

## Engaging the organisation
With Kvipp, you have a tool to implement and document equipment-specific training. The training requirement may be unknown among employees, so we always recommend a review of what equipment-specific training is and how it should be addressed with Kvipp. See more tips on the "get started" page.

## How to do it
- Go to the website [kvipp.it](https://kvipp.it)
- Who will use the equipment? - identify yourself with an HSE card or other ID such as a driving licence or passport. By using the HSE card, the training is automatically linked to both the right person and company, and the company automatically gets an ongoing overview of all training in Kvipp Admin.
"QR": Scan the QR code on the HSE card
"Take picture": Use artificial intelligence to recognise first name, surname and date of birth
- Which equipment? - identify the equipment to be used.
"QR": If the equipment has a QR code from DigiQuip or Reginn, you can scan this QR code and see the make and type.
"Take picture": Use artificial intelligence to recognise make and type. The serial number plate often has the correct information.

## Identify work equipment without and with QR code

**Without QR code**
1 Go to the website kvipp.it.
2 Scan your HSE card.
3 Use artificial intelligence to identify make and model. **Make sure to take a picture that captures both make and model, and that it is read correctly.**
4 Register your own training
5 Start practical training
6 Go through the general checklist
7 Add the participants at the end of the session

**With QR codes from DigiQuip or Reginn**
Go to kvipp.it and scan the QR code, then follow the same process as above. Read more about how to connect QR codes under work equipment.

**Search and create equipment**
With the Asset owner role, which is given under permissions in Kvipp Admin, you can search and create equipment. You get a new option called "search". Then follow the wizard.

## Registration of equipment-specific training
When you are about to start equipment-specific training, you can either receive training from someone else or complete a self-declaration.

If you already have documentation, you can upload it. This makes it easier to show documentation at short notice.

## How to provide training
To provide training, you must first register your own training. Then you get the option "provide training" and the training session can be started.

1.Identify yourself and the equipment
2.Start by selecting "provide training"
3.Go through a general checklist
4.Add the participants at the end by taking a picture or scanning ID cards. There is no upper limit to how many participants can be added

## How to find completed training
All training is automatically registered on the employee. Managers can find all training completed in Kvipp Admin. Go to kvipp.it/admin, select person and see what training they have. Training certificates can also be downloaded here.

If you wish to receive all training certificates by email, scan your HSE card and next to your name you can expand the section and find the option to add an email. Add email and tick to receive previous training certificates by email.

## Don't have HSE cards?
With HSE cards, all training is automatically saved on the company. If you don't have HSE cards, employees must be added manually in Kvipp Admin. First, the person must identify themselves with a driving licence or passport. When a driving licence or passport is recognised, it is important that the person checks that the first name, surname and date of birth are correct. This way they are captured in the system and can then be added manually.

## Grouping equipment and/or persons
Groups are designed to simplify the work of ensuring that people have necessary training. Perhaps you want to group by profession, to plan when hiring new people or as a temporary project, then you can test out groups for this.

In addition, you can print a QR code for the group. When you scan that QR code, all the equipment appears. This gives you a shortcut to start training on many pieces of equipment simultaneously.

## What is the "instructor" role?

With the instructor role, the person providing training gets more options:
- Can provide training on multiple equipment in the same session.
- Can provide training on behalf of the company. The training certificate will state that training is given on behalf of the company.

The role is assigned on the page called permissions.

## Training others on behalf of our company
With the "instructor" role, all training sessions appear in an overview. The overview includes all people that the instructor has trained - both internal and external. To retrieve who has received training, you can search by participant name and equipment type. Here you also have the option to send documentation (PDF) directly by email.
