# Get started with DigiQuip

:::note[Note]

The description below is primarily for customers intending to use the DigiQuip software as a system for competence and equipment management. If you require a specialised add-on for your existing system landscape (integration, widget, etc.), or a solution solely for training field workers, [get in touch](https://digiquip.no/about).

:::

Once the decision to use DigiQuip has been made, we assist you in getting started. Typically, three hours per customer, with larger setup packages available as needed.

Checklist for getting started:

- [ ] Goal for the implementation
- [ ] Add departments and users
- [ ] Add machines and equipment
- [ ] Training settings

## 1. Your goal

It's easier for us to provide the support you need if you share what you aim to achieve with the implementation. Therefore, we always want to know how the customer defines success.

## 2. Departments and users

First, create departments and then users. Users are invited to the solution via email or SMS. See the chapter "user management" for more information.

## 3. Equipment

If the solution is to be used for performing and tracking trainings and/or machine inspections (expert, inspection, and maintenance), it's relevant to add models and machines. Machines can be added manually, through import or via integrations. Some of our customers, for example, have machines in the "Maskinregisteret" (by Sentralregisteret), and machines can be imported from there free of charge.

After adding the equipment, put QR codes and NFC tags on the equipment. This makes it easy for workers and others to find relevant information and do trainings and inspections. QR code labels come in different sizes and are attached to the equipment. NFC tags are more suitable for items such as harnesses. Contact us for ordering at support@digiquip.no. For sizes and prices, see [more details here](https://digiquip.no/docs/prices/detailed-price-list).

See the chapter "equipment management" for more information.

## 4. Training settings

When the company uses DigiQuip for trainings, you need to decide how training should be approved and who can provide training to others.

See the chapters "competence management" and "training" for more information.

Now that machines and personnel have been added, you're ready to start! See our other help pages for more information. If you can't find what you need, contact your point of contact or email us at support@digiquip.no.
