# Design instructions

## Logo

The hard hat represents our users at working sites, while the colour represent our goal to improve safety and derives from the safety colour (ANSI Z535). The font derives from our legible UI Inter font we use in our user interface.

## Colours

We strive for a simple and strict colour palette with distinct differences.
​
In our solution, we use colours for highlighting important content, while in marketing, we also bring some flavour to details.​
​
Our marketing materials are dark and restricted while our software is mainly light with colour stack variants. We strive to uphold a minimum contrast ratio of 3:1 (WCAG AA 18pt+) in our software to support legibility in challenging weather conditions.
